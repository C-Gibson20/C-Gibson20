<p>Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a passionate student (Imperial College, London) dedicated to exploring various aspects of machine learning, deep learning, data science, and algorithmic trading strategies. My projects range from practical implementations of trading strategies to deep learning tasks, time series forecasting, and data automation scripts.</p>

#### Key Areas of Focus:
<p>Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Projects involving signature verification using a CNN with triplet loss and challenges from the DeepML platform.<br>
Data Science & Analysis: Time series forecasting using ARIMA, data flow automation, and other relevant data science tasks.<br>
Algorithmic Trading: Implementation of multiple trading strategies, including those inspired by the QuantConnect Algorithmic Trading Bootcamp.<br>
Computer Vision: A project focusing on the generation and detection of ArUco markers through video.</p>

#### Learning
<p>As a student, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in these domains. I am particularly interested in deepening my understanding of machine and deep learning, and data-driven trading strategies. I enjoy tackling new challenges and taking on a diverse range of projects to broaden my expertise.</p>

#### Looking Forward
<p>I am committed to furthering my exploration in these areas and look forward to contributing more complex and impactful projects in the future.</p>

#### Additional Work
<p>I have successfully completed a series of specialized courses on Kaggle, encompassing foundational and advanced topics in machine learning, data visualization, and deep learning. These courses include "Intro to Machine Learning," "Pandas," "Intermediate Machine Learning," "Data Visualization," "Intro to Deep Learning," "Time Series," and "Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning." Through these certifications, I have developed a strong understanding of data science methodologies, machine learning algorithms, and their applications.</p>
