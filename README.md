### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a project portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python 

### About Me
I'm a full-time university student 
I started learning Python less than a year ago and I am now looking to challenge myself by taking on some projects. I would like to build a portfolio and start contributing to opensource projects to further progress my coding skills.
Whilst Python is the language I am dedicated to improving in, my long-term goal is to become proficient in more programming languages.
