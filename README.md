# Welcome

Hi, I'm a 3rd year Electronic and Information Engineering MEng student at Imperial College London focused on intelligent systems, applied machine learning, and computational engineering.<br>

My work spans:
- **Research**: Modelling neural processes in the Neural Reckoning group
- **Personal projects**: Practical applications of deep learning in image classification, natural language processing, finance, and computer vision
- **Coursework**: Systems-level engineering, including CPU design, compilers, and FPGA acceleration

<br>

## Research and Technical Projects

- [Computational Neuroscience Modelling](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/computational-neuroscience-modelling)  
  RL and DL agents replicating experimental brain behaviour for cognitive hypothesis generation.

- [Signature Verification (Siamese CNN)](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/signature-verification)  
  ResNet50 Siamese network with triplet loss and TPU optimisation. Achieved 83.9% validation accuracy.

- [Financial Sentiment Analysis (BERT)](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/financial-sentiment-analysis)  
  Fine-tuned BERT model using synonym augmentation, Focal Loss, and Hugging Face transformers.

- [LSTM-Based Trading Strategy](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/lstm-strategy)  
  Predictive stock strategy using LSTM networks and walk-forward validation.

- [EMA Turning Point Strategy](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/ema-turning-point-strategy)  
  Event-driven crypto trading bot detecting EMA inflection points.

## University Coursework Projects

- [RISC-V CPU Design (Group)](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/RISC-V-Team17-CPU)  
  5-stage pipelined CPU in SystemVerilog with instruction, data cache and hazard detection.

- [FPGA CFD Accelerator (Group)](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/FPGA-Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-Accelerator)  
  Implemented a hardware fluid dynamics solver using fixed-point arithmetic and parallelism on Quartus.

- [C90 to RISC-V Compiler (Group)](https://github.com/C-Gibson20/C90-RISC-V-Compiler)  
  Wrote a working C-to-assembly compiler with custom tokenizer, parser, and code generator.
